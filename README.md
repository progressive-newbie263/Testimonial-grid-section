 tailwind grid section practice

 live site: https://progressive-newbie263.github.io/Testimonial-grid-section/

- well, i am proud to say my first time trying out tailwind css in a project ended up decently xD. I expected it would have gone much worse

-choosing tailwind for this grid section was a bad idea tbh. since the 5 card could have been finished faster with inserting class, and changing 5 of them as a whole

- idk why but when i use grid in tailwind, the padding bottom / margin bottom just disappear. Been searching for it but can't find any solution to fix it. I hope i can hear some tips and tricks about it
